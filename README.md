# JProbStats
Problem - Implement functions for basic function and various distribution function in Statistics and provide probabilistic solutions.

The basic approach is to develop a data set which is immutable and functional (it means a data set which can be applied to any funtion) and to implement various methods of Statistics and Probaility in a functional way.

Solution - Using the knowledge of Funtional programming with Java, implement the Statistical funtions.

Implementation - The implementation of this problem is divided into:
			1. Develop an immutable data set.
			2. Implement Statistical functions.
			3. Implement Probabilistic functions.
			4. Case studies.
